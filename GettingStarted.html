        <h2>How to Get Weapons</h2>
        <p><b>Nail gun:</b> this is a weapon that allows us to attack from a distance and has ammunition throughout the mansion, in this sense, we must embark on the search for it and this makes us advance along the only path that we will see until we reach the basement and in this way get access to the X-ray room, there we must ambush by an enemy in a wheelchair, it will only be enough to run to the end of the corridor to enter through the door without closing, once we access the priest will activate a Short scene and we will hold a dialogue and then receive the nail gun, it will only be enough to put some ammunition on it and for this it will be necessary to look behind the priest on our right, we will go out and face the enemy that has pursued us previously.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Lever:</b> this is another necessary weapon to find here and it is usually a melee weapon, it can be used when we do not have ammunition for the nail gun, just like the gun we must embark on a search in the X-ray room alone that this is usually housed on some boxes on the left side of the room.</p>

                <h2>TIPS#1: Don't Stop Killing</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest difficulties a player can face while playing Tormented Souls is the fact that enemies 
                are everywhere, and they are difficult to avoid. Players can try to avoid them for as long as possible, 
                but the game does require a lot of backtracking.</p>

                <h2>TIPS#2: Keep The Lighter Equipped, Unless Fighting Enemies</h2>
                <p>The lighter is going to be the player's best item to use, because it will light up the surrounding area and 
                ensure that there isn't a monster bounding towards the player. It's worth nothing a player can walk into 
                complete darkness at any second, so light is their best friend.</p>

                <h2>TIPS#3: The Game's Clock Keeps Running, Even if it's Paused</h2>
                <p>This may not seem like much to most people, but even when paused, the game's clock won't stop running. For 
                people who want to gain the speed-running achievement, this is going to be one of the hardest things that 
                will block them from gaining that.</p>

                <h2>TIPS#4: Exit a Room to Cause the Monster to De-Spawn</h2>
                <p>There are times when players won't exactly be able to fully finish off the monster once and for all. Whether 
                their weapon isn't the best, they're out of ammo, or facing other debilitating circumstances, there will be 
                occasions when the best course of action is to run from a randomly-generated monster.</p>

                <h2>TIPS#5: The Good Ending Requires a Certain Item</h2>
                <p>There is a good ending that a player can achieve within Tormented Souls. However, it does require the 
                player to pick up a certain item before they enter the point of no return. Granted, this point does come 
                very late in the game.</p>

                <h2>TIPS#6: Combine Ammo with the Gun to Reload</h2>
                <p>There are multiple different ways to reload guns within Tormented Souls, such as the classic "reloading after 
                running out of ammo from shooting monsters." However, players have figured out a much quicker way to reload 
                the gun after shooting. Don't worry, no cheats are required.</p>
